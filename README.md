👋 Hi, I’m Sadiq – your go-to tech enthusiast buddy!

👀 Passionate about all things Tech and Computer Science – I can’t get enough of those ones and zeros!

🎓 I’m an undergraduate student at Kingston University London, diving deep into Computer Science with a focus on Software Engineering.

🌱 Currently learning and thriving on new challenges, always staying updated with the latest tech trends.

🚀 On the hunt for an awesome team to join and create tech wonders together – let's make some magic happen!

💡 Quick on the uptake and cool under pressure – I excel at picking up new ideas fast and keeping my calm in fast-paced environments.

🤝 Teamwork makes the dream work! I thrive in collaborative settings and value clear, effective communication with colleagues.

📫 You can reach me at mail2sdq99@gmail.com – carrier pigeons and smoke signals also accepted for extra points!

⚡ Fun fact: I can code in Java while juggling – okay, maybe not yet, but I'm working on it!
